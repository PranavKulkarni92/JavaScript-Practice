/*
concept:-unary operator

Refer JavaScript.INfO

unary operator + applied to a single value , doesn't do anything to numbers.
But if operand is not a number , the unary plus converts it into a number.

! negation tries to convert to boolean , truthy to false [which is he case here]
and falsy to true
